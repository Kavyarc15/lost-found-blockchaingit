## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ and npm
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or Brave Browser (with Brave Wallet)
- (Optional) [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) account for IPFS image storage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kavyarc15/lost-found-blockchaingit.git
cd lost-found-blockchaingit
```

### Step 2: Install Smart Contract Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Compile the Smart Contract

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Step 4: Run Tests (Optional)

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

You should see all **15 tests passing**:

```
  LostAndFound
    ✔ deploys with correct admin
    ✔ allows finder to report item with image hash
    ✔ emits ItemReported event with correct data
    ✔ rejects report with empty name
    ✔ rejects report with empty image hash
    ✔ allows owner to file claim on a reported item
    ✔ prevents finder from claiming own item
    ✔ prevents claiming an already-claimed item
    ✔ allows claimant to confirm return with photo
    ✔ prevents non-claimant from confirming return
    ✔ executes full Reported → Claimed → Returned flow
    ✔ allows admin to dispute a reported item
    ✔ blocks non-admin from disputing
    ✔ allows admin to resolve dispute back to Reported
    ✔ tracks items by finder and owner

  15 passing (1s)
```

### Step 5: Start the Local Blockchain

Open a terminal and start the Hardhat node (keep this running):

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This gives you **20 test accounts** each with **10,000 ETH**. Note the private keys — you'll need them later.

### Step 6: Deploy the Contract

In a **new terminal**:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Output:
```
Deploying with: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
LostAndFound deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
ABI + address saved to frontend/src/contracts/LostAndFound.json
```

### Step 7: Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Step 8: Configure Pinata (Optional)

For real IPFS image storage, create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `frontend/.env` with your Pinata keys:

```env
VITE_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
VITE_PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key
```

> **Note:** Without Pinata keys, the app uses a localStorage mock — images work locally but aren't stored permanently.

### Step 9: Start the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at **http://localhost:5173/**

### Step 10: Configure Your Wallet

1. **Add the Hardhat Local network** to MetaMask or Brave Wallet:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Network Name | `Hardhat Local` |
   | RPC URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8545` |
   | Chain ID | `31337` |
   | Currency Symbol | `ETH` |

2. **Import a test account** using a Hardhat private key:

   ```
   Account #0: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
   Account #1: 0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d
   ```

3. **Switch to the Hardhat Local network** in your wallet

4. You should see **10,000 ETH** in your test account

> ⚠️ These are test accounts with fake ETH. Never use them on mainnet.

## ☁️ Running in GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a full development environment in the cloud — no local setup needed!

### Step 1: Open in Codespaces

1. Go to **https://github.com/Kavyarc15/lost-found-blockchaingit**
2. Click the green **`<> Code`** button
3. Select the **`Codespaces`** tab
4. Click **`Create codespace on main`**
5. Wait for the environment to build (1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

In the Codespaces terminal:

```bash
# Install smart contract dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Compile & Test the Contract

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

### Step 4: Start the Hardhat Node

Open a **new terminal** (click the `+` icon in the terminal panel):

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Keep this terminal running.

### Step 5: Deploy the Contract

Open **another new terminal**:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Step 6: Configure Pinata (Optional)

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your Pinata API keys (use the Codespaces built-in editor).

### Step 7: Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --host
```

> **Important:** The `--host` flag is required in Codespaces to make the dev server accessible.

### Step 8: Access the App

1. Codespaces will show a **pop-up** saying "Your application running on port 5173 is available"
2. Click **"Open in Browser"** — this gives you a public URL like `https://xxx-5173.app.github.dev/`
3. You can also find it in the **PORTS** tab at the bottom of Codespaces

### Step 9: Connect Your Wallet

1. In MetaMask / Brave Wallet, add a **custom network**:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Network Name | `Codespace Hardhat` |
   | RPC URL | Your Codespace's **port 8545 URL** (find in PORTS tab, e.g. `https://xxx-8545.app.github.dev/`) |
   | Chain ID | `31337` |
   | Currency Symbol | `ETH` |

   > **Important:** In the **PORTS** tab, right-click port `8545` and set visibility to **Public** so your wallet can reach it.

2. Import a Hardhat test account (same private keys as above)
3. Connect your wallet on the app

### Codespaces Tips

- You get **60 hours/month free** on the GitHub Free plan
- Use **2-core** machine type for this project (sufficient)
- All 3 terminals (Hardhat node, deploy, frontend) can run simultaneously in Codespaces
- The forwarded port URLs are publicly accessible — you can share them for demos!

### ⚠️ After Codespace Restarts / Hardhat Node Restarts

If your Codespace restarts (idle timeout, etc.) or you restart the Hardhat node, you **must** follow these steps:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Restart Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# Terminal 2: Redeploy the contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

# Terminal 3: Restart the frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev -- --host
```

Then in your browser wallet (Brave Wallet / MetaMask):
1. Go to **Settings → Web3** (Brave) or **Settings → Advanced** (MetaMask)
2. Click **"Clear wallet transaction and nonce information"** (Brave) or **"Clear activity tab data"** (MetaMask)
3. Refresh the app page and reconnect your wallet

> **Note:** The app has **automatic nonce recovery** built-in — if you get a nonce error, the app will auto-fix it and retry the transaction. But clearing wallet data after a node restart gives the cleanest experience.

---

## 🧪 Testing the Full Flow

To test the complete lifecycle, you need **two different wallet accounts**:

### User A (Finder):
1. Connect wallet with **Account #0**
2. Click **"Report Found Item"**
3. Fill in item details + upload a photo
4. Submit to blockchain → see the item on the dashboard

### User B (Owner):
1. Switch to **Account #1** in your wallet (or use a different browser)
2. The **lego car** (or whatever item) appears on the dashboard
3. Click the item → click **"This Is Mine — File Claim"**
4. After physical handover, click **"Upload Confirmation Photo"**
5. Upload a photo and click **"Confirm Return & Complete"**
6. ✅ Contract is closed! Both photos are displayed side by side.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Nonce too high" Error (Most Common)

**Symptom:** Transaction fails with:
```
-32000: Nonce too high. Expected nonce to be 1 but got 8.
Note that transactions can't be queued when automining.
```

**Cause:** The Hardhat node restarted (resetting account nonces to 0), but your wallet (Brave / MetaMask) still remembers the old nonce from previous sessions.

**Fix — Option A (Automatic):**
The app has built-in nonce recovery. Just **click "Retry"** or **submit the transaction again** — it will:
1. Detect the nonce mismatch from the error
2. Call `hardhat_setNonce` on the Hardhat node to sync
3. Retry the transaction automatically

**Fix — Option B (Manual Clear):**

| Wallet | Steps |
|---|---|
| **Brave Wallet** | Settings → Web3 → Click **"Clear wallet transaction and nonce information"** |
| **MetaMask** | Settings → Advanced → Click **"Clear activity tab data"** |

After clearing, **refresh the page** and try again.

**Fix — Option C (Full Reset):**
If A and B don't work, do a full reset:
```bash
# 1. Stop everything (Ctrl+C in all terminals)

# 2. Restart Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# 3. Redeploy the contract (new terminal)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

# 4. Restart frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend && npm run dev -- --host

# 5. Clear wallet data (see table above)
# 6. Refresh the app and reconnect wallet
```

---

### "Contract not deployed" Error

**Symptom:** Dashboard shows "Contract not deployed" message.

**Fix:** The Hardhat node was restarted without redeploying the contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
Then refresh the page.

---

### Wallet Shows 0 ETH on Hardhat Network

**Fix:** Import a Hardhat test account private key:
```
Account #0: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
Account #1: 0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d
```
Make sure you're on the **Hardhat Local** network (Chain ID: 31337).

---

### Images Not Uploading

**Fix:** Make sure you have Pinata API keys configured:
```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Pinata keys
```
Without Pinata keys, images are stored in browser localStorage (temporary).

---

### Codespaces: "Cannot connect to wallet" or RPC errors

**Fix:**
1. Go to the **PORTS** tab in Codespaces
2. Right-click port **8545** → Set visibility to **Public**
3. Use that public URL as the RPC URL in your wallet
4. Make sure the Hardhat node is running in a terminal

---

## 🛡️ Security

- **Admin-only functions**: `disputeItem` and `resolveDispute` restricted to deployer
- **Self-claim prevention**: Finder cannot claim their own item
- **Input validation**: Name, location, and image hash are required
- **Status enforcement**: Items must follow the correct lifecycle sequence
- **No real funds**: Uses local Hardhat network with test ETH
- **Auto nonce recovery**: Built-in handling for nonce mismatches after node restarts
